Spotify Now Playing plugin for HexChat

Project is compiled targeting Visual Studio 2015.
I am using Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition as my IDE.

This code makes use of an unsupported SpotifyLookUpLib to interact with Spotify..
As for the Spotify Library (.lib) file... There are no plans to release this to the public...

**Talk to me on IRC (you know where to find me) if you have more questions..**
