# hcircify
Spotify Now Playing plugin for HexChat

Project is compiled targeting Visual Studio 2015.
I am using Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition as my IDE.

This code makes use of the (Equalify) SpotifyLookUpLib to interact with Spotify..
As for the Equalify Spotify Library (.lib) file... There are no plans to release this to the public...

**Talk to us @ irc.equalify.me #equalify if you have more questions..**
